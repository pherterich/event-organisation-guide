Catering
========

Prices for catering should have been used for the budget projection at the FS stage.

When submitting an order for the workshop, the EL or their designate in this matter should take into consideration
people's dietary requirements which should have been asked at registration time.

The EL (or designate) should find out from the caterers when is the latest date to submit an order. It might be worth ordering
5%-10% extra meals if you envisage extra registrations between ordering the food and the event. This should be factored
into the budget preferably at the FS stage (the `budget template
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aM2pPFgV2kurA4G7L8AT1GTyeWRj2fo3ner_jsTzSEU/edit#gid=0>`_ shows an example
of this).

It might be tempting to order the cheapest things on the menu to meet the budget but at a multi-day event having
variety, quality and reasonable portions can help keep the participants fuelled for learning and interaction. If you
are charging your audience to attend the event then it is best to give careful consideration to catering and order something reasonable.

It can be time-consuming to arrange catering so this might be best assigned as a task to someone during resource
allocation.
