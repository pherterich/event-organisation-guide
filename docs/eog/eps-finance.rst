Procurement
-----------
Procurement needs to be well managed throughout the project. If costs are being met by an institution then the rules and regulations of the institution need to be followed, otherwise you risk delays or even not being able to pay supplier and a real loss of reputation as well as a lot of aggravation. Thus, some due diligence here can pay dividends. Have a meeting with your institutional finance people, talk to them about some of the lines in you :doc:`eps-budget` and get their view on how they should be managed. 

Here are some common points that can appear during such conversations:

- Over a certain amount of expenditure you may need to get three quotes before choosing a particular venue and venue related services (e.g. catering)
- Supplier often need to be registered with an institution before they can be paid (so it is best to get this done early)
- Before an invoice from a supplier can be paid there should have been a matching purchase order (PO), i.e. a request for services (the PO) should match a request for payment(the invoice).  
- It's worth asking how smaller suppliers can be paid:
   - Can this be done via a one off payment?
   - Is some form of registration required? If so what are the requirments.


Income
------
If the financials are being run through and institution it is also important to think about how income is handled. 

Some considerations include:

- How is sponsorship best claimed
   - Will it go into an existing project related code or are there special codes that can be used to hold the money (e.g. ones that might allow greater flexibility)
- Will other automated income (e.g. via Eventbrite for registration) be routed correctly 
- What is the support for chasing people who paid by a purchase order, who will be able to raise the appropriate invoices

Again having good connetions with the financial staff at the institution which is where the budget is held is necessary to make sure the procedures are clear and known.
