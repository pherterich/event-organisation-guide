Event Roles
===========

Certain roles
(see `examples roles <https://zenodo.org/record/3967427>`_)
are needed before, during and after the event. These roles can vary
depending on the balance of the event and some of the roles naturally go together. Role allocations should be done carefully as some combination of roles might be incompatible with engaging in events or require local knowledge or skills, so they would only be suitable for certain types of individual.

A duties roster
***************

For medium-sized or large events, it is essential to put together a duties roster
(see `example roster <https://zenodo.org/record/3967445>`_)
before the event, so people with different roles know what they need to be doing at specific times. Scheduling duties
decreases problems with communication during the event, as every team member clearly knows what they've agreed to do at specific times throughout the event. Duties usually forgotten when creating the schedule are registration and reception.

For the Event Lead, there may be assumptions about who should be included in the roster. For example, the Collaborations Workshop is the premier
event of the Institute, so all staff are expected to attend and possibly have a role. Where this is not
the case, doing a call out to the organisation or even asking a local contact for volunteers may be the right way to go.
PhD students helping at events has a long tradition, though you should consider rewarding them for their efforts at
the end of the workshop.
