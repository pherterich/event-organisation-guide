CW20 Committees
=====================

The CW20 Steering Committee comprised of representatives from Belfast, the workshop sponsors and the Institute. 
Members helped to guide the agenda and direction of the workshop, provided advice for running the event and contributed to many of the workshop sessions.
Before publicly announcing that CW20 would move online, we notified the Steering Committee of our contingency investigation and decision to replace the in-person event with a virtual one. 

The Organising Committee comprised of representatives from Belfast and the Institute. 
Members had more regular communication, with a focus on logistics and identifying and being responsible for roles/duties needed to run the event.
Once the decision was made to cancel the in-person event in Belfast and move CW20 online, the committee members from the Institute worked to 
- Create and test the :ref:`infrastructure<CW20 Infrastructure>` for running a virtual event 
- Reformat the :ref:`agenda<CW20 Agenda>` for the online setting
- Adapt the :ref:`publicity<CW20 Publicity>`
- Help run the event on the day
