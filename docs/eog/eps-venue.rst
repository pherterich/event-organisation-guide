=====

Securing a suitable venue is one of the most critical aspects of an event and can make the difference between a good and an
excellent event. It is also (typically) the most expensive line in your :doc:`eps-budget`. 

You can have a look in more detail at various venue
requirements you should consider in the `venue
requirements template document <https://zenodo.org/record/4064079>`_
and adjust it based on your expected number of delegates and the event's programme. Remember that no single
venue will satisfy all your needs and you will have to prioritise your requirements in terms what is a must, what would help and what is optional for your particular event instance. Here we outline various aspects of venue
requirements which you should consider and prioritise for an event.

- Capacity
    - The main plenary room's capacity should be double the number of delegates for a comfortable fit, and there should be enough rooms and spaces to support different event requirements
- Areas that support additional event requirements
    - Registration, main plenary room, breakout rooms, communal/break space, poster/sponsor exhibition, storage, quiet space, workspace, video and photography, prayer room, etc.
- Location
    - Ideally located in a place with some wow factor and easily accessible by public transport (ideally with some nearby parking too)
- Infrastructure
    - WiFi, A/V, video streaming/recording, power points, sound and portable microphones
- Catering at the main event
    - Catering for people with different dietary needs and food allergies, clear labelling of food
- Facilities
    - Storage, toilets, fridge for medication/milk, water points, printing, childcare on-site (or nearby nursery), proximity to prayer rooms (if none available on site)
- Accessibility 
    - Accessibility of the venue by public transport and within the venue ( consider, for example, thelocation of accessible toilets, the accessibility of various rooms, and signposting clearly for ease of orientation)
- Environment sustainability considerations
    - The use of plastic vs sustainable cutlery and crockery for serving food, what happens to the leftover food
- Conference dinner hosting
    - The possibility of hosting the conference dinner at the venue
