=====

Securing a good venue is one of the most important aspects of the event and can really make a difference between a good and an
excellent event. It is also the most expensive line in your :doc:`eps-budget`. 

You can have a look in more detail at various venue
requirements you should consider in `our example venue
requirements template document <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BJsjr4Y-cTBeEEjV5A_VVQ2hZIPsgBivhpin8gLJyb4/edit>`_
and adjust it based on your own capacity and programme needs. Remember that not a single
venue will satisfy all your needs and you will have to prioritise your requirements in terms what is a must, what would
really help and what is optional for your particular event instance. Here we outline various aspects of venue
requirements which you should consider and prioritise for an event.

- Capacity
    - the main plenary room's capacity should be double the number of delegates for comfortable fit, there should be enough rooms and spaces to support different event requirements
- Spaces that support different event requirements
    - registration, main plenary room, breakout rooms, communal/break space, poster/sponsor exhibition, storage, quiet space, work space, photo taking, prayer room, etc.
- Location
    - ideally located in a place with some wow factor and easily accessible by public transport (ideally with some nearby parking too)
- Infrastructure
    - WiFi, A/V, video streaming/recording, power points, sound and portable microphones

    - catering for people with different dietary needs and food allergies, clear labelling of food
