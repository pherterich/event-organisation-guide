When to Start Planning
----------------------
For events such as a Collaborations Workshop, it’s important that the idea and feasibility stages start early – anywhere from 9 to 12 months before the event –  to allow enough time for promotion, calls for sponsorship, registration, calls for participation, and to get the date into your target audience’s diaries early before other events are announced. 

For smaller events or workshops, e.g. Software and Data Carpentry, 3–6 months are normally enough.

For online webinar type events, 1–2 months is enough time.
