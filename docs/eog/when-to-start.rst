When to Start Planning
----------------------
For large events, such as a `Collaborations Workshop <https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/collaborations-workshops>`_, it’s important that the idea and feasibility stages start anywhere from nine to twelve months before the event. This is primarily due to the complexity of the event. This will allow enough time for the feasibility stage requirements to be met and the event project stage to have sufficient time to do publicity, sponsorship, registration, calls for participation. This also allows the date to get into the target audience’s diaries before other events are announced. 

For smaller events or workshops, e.g. Software and Data Carpentry, three to sixth months are normally enough.

For online webinar type events, one to two months is enough time.
