.. _Risk-Identification:

Risk Identification
===================
The first stage of risk management is identifying risks. Note that as risk management is an ongoing activity, new threats will come up as the event organisation proceed, existing potential issues will be re-phrased, and some others will be deleted. Risk management will take place until the :doc:`eps-closing-down`.

Here are some examples of risks identified when organising an event such as the `Collaborations Workshop <https://software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/collaborations-workshops>`_ or `CarpentryConnect <https://software.ac.uk/ccmcr19>`_.

- The main stakeholder
    - Event goals not aligned with the main stakeholder goals
    - Incidents during the event can damage the main stakeholder's reputation

- Sponsors
    - Not enough sponsorship
    - Offers made to sponsors that cannot be fulfilled
    - Sponsor's logo is not displayed at all at the event (or not displayed appropriately), spelling and branding mistakes occur

- Keynote speakers
    - Delay in confirmation or dropping out
    - Speaker goes off track in their talk or uses offensive language

- Attendees
    - Not enough attendees or many dropping out right before the event

- Policies, guidelines and documentation
    - Lack of information or information dispersed at various locations
    - Lack of clearly stated policies and guidelines (e.g. Code of Conduct policy and breach reporting and handling procedures, privacy policy, contribution guide)

See `the example risk management template <https://zenodo.org/record/4088024>`_ for more information on how to elaborate on identified risks, e.g. using the `if-then method for writing up risks <https://projectriskcoach.com/the-power-of-if-then-risk-statements/>`_ can help to formulate and infer mitigation plans.
