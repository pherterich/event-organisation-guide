Event Safety
============

The safety and comfort of participants is paramount at the actual event, this requires information and processes to be available and in place.

Safety information
------------------
As a minimum there is various information which should be available and at hand for organisers and participants to make use of if the need arises. This includes:

- Venue contacts
   - Medical emergency number
   - Site security number 
   - Fire warden number or help number (e.g. for evacuation of disabled participants)

- City contacts
   - Medical emergency number (e.g. 999 in the UK)
   - Security emergency number (e.g. for the Police)
   - Address of the nearest Accident and Emergency equipped Hospital
   - Address of Medical practioners who offer walk-in services
   - Address of the nearest pharmacy

Code of Conduct
---------------
As well as medical and security matters which will be governned by institutional and legal authority under which the venue operates. A Code of Conduct (CoC) goes further to mandate standards of behaviour and interaction expected from organisers and participants. These are becoming increasingly common at events and show a commitment to running a safe event. In some cases they need to be in place before potential sponsors will agree to sponser event.

The CoC should come as set of documents that cover:

- The CoC itself (e.g the `CW19 Code of Conduct <https://software.ac.uk/cw19/code-conduct>`_)

- How to report a violation (e.g. the `CW19 - Attendee Procedure For Reporting Harassment <https://software.ac.uk/cw19/code-of-conduct/harassment-reporting-procedure>`_)

- The approach the CoC committee for the event will hand reports (e.g. the `CW19 - Staff Procedure For Handling Reported Harassment <https://www.software.ac.uk/cw19/code-of-conduct/staff-procedure-handling-reported-harassment>`_)
