Risk Management
===============

Risks are events that could have a negative impact on the project. Risk management (or risk analysis) is the process of
identifying and assessing potential risks and their impact. Every risk assessment
should be followed by a risk mitigation plan - actions designed to eliminate or minimise the impact of the identified
risks.
