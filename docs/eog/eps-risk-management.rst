Risk Management
===============
Risks are situations that could happen that could impact your event (usually negatively). Risk management in the EOG context is the process of identifying potential situations that could impact your event, assessing the liklihood and impact of such situations and then preparing risk mitigation plans for those situations which are beyond the background risk your event is willing to accept. 

Risk management is an ongoing activity in the organisation of an event; situations that can occur change, the liklihood and impact can change and the possible mitigations can change.

**Note** - What we describe here is a tailored approach. In risk assessment, risk proximity is also a factor (e.g. how close you are in time to a potential risk), we have not included this, if you did then you risk assessment matrix would have a 3rd dimension. The approach here is an example and one that should be tailored to your event needs - the more complex, expensive and novel an event is, the more effort needs to be devoted to risk management.
