CW21 Event Roles
=================

We had similar event roles as at :ref:`CW20 <CW20-Event-Roles>`.
Again we ensured that we had at least two people assigned for each role/duty as contingency in case someone had to drop out of the event for any reason. 
CW is the premier event of the Institute, so all staff were expected to attend and able to fill most roles. 
Institute Fellows, collaborators and CW21 Sponsors filled remaining roles on the Code of Conduct Committee and Hack Day judging committee. 

We reused documentation from CW20 to make sure that everyone knew their roles and responsibilities: we created a `duties roster <https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12498122>`_, wrote `instructions for Zoom Hosts and Co-hosts <https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12498191>`_, created a `spreadsheet of the various roles and Zoom room links for the parallel sessions <https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12498164>`_, and provided an `index of links <https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12459656>`_ to point to all these documents and to help people find anything else related to CW21 that they would need (links to each dayâ€™s collaborative notes document, Zoom rooms, communication channels, session information, etc.).
 
We organised test calls for CW21 helpers and Zoom Hosts to make sure all the necessary features were enabled for each account (breakout rooms, co-hosts, non-verbal feedback, automatic recording, live transcription and captioning via Otter.ia, etc.) and to let the Hosts gain experience using these features. 

See the :ref:`cw21-eps-timeline` for a breakdown of the various tasks and when they took place.
