CW21 Committees
================

Steering Committee
-------------------

The CW21 Steering Committee comprised of representatives from the Institute, the workshop sponsors, experts in virtual event organisation, and experts in FAIR Research Software, Diversity and Inclusion, and Software Sustainability (the workshop themes). 
We held monthly meetings where members helped to guide the agenda and direction of the workshop (recommending speakers and session types), provided advice for running the event (recommending platforms and how to improve accessibility) and contributed to many of the workshop sessions.


Organising Committee
---------------------

The CW21 Organising Committee comprised of representatives from the Institute. 
Members had more regular communication, with a focus on logistics and identifying and being responsible for roles/duties needed to run the event.
Organising Committee members worked to 

- Create and test the :ref:`infrastructure <cw21-eps-infrastructure>` for running the virtual event 
- Help with the event :ref:`publicity <cw21-eps-publicity>`
- Help :ref:`run the event <cw21-eps-event-roles>` on the day


Code of Conduct Committee
--------------------------

The CW21 Code of Conduct (CoC) Committee comprised of three members who were Institute staff and two external. 
There was a mix of gender, race and career stage within the Committee to provide a range of options for participants to choose who they felt most comfortable reporting to.
Two members of the Committee had participated in `Code of Conduct Incident Response training <https://otter.technology/code-of-conduct-training/>`_. 

Before the event, we sent the following to CoC Committee members to read through and raise any issues or questions:

- The `Code of Conduct <https://software.ac.uk/cw21/participation-guidelines#code-of-conduct>`_
- The `Attendee Procedure for Reporting Harassment <https://software.ac.uk/cw21/participation-guidelines/harassment-reporting-procedure>`_
- The `Staff Procedure For Handling Reported Harassment <https://software.ac.uk/cw21/participation-guidelines/staff-procedure-handling-reported-harassment>`_

All of these materials were made available within the `CW21 Participation Guidelines <https://software.ac.uk/cw21/participation-guidelines>`_ which participants had to have read and agreed to abide by at registration.  

During the event, we had a private Slack channel in the CW21 Slack workspace for CoC Committee members in case any incidents arose.
No misconduct was reported from CW21.
