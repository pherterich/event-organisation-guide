CW21 Sponsorship
=================

We adapted the `sponsorship packages from CW20 <https://software.ac.uk/cw20/sponsorship>`_ to add more value to sponsors in a virtual event and summarised the packages on the `CW21 website <https://software.ac.uk/cw21/sponsorship>`_.
We kept the tiered packages of Silver, Gold and Platinum, with increasing benefits respectively.
Benefits we added include:

- Place on CW21 Steering Committee
- Increased number of free registrations
- Slide shown during breaks
- Dedicated breakout room for people to speak to you during the breaks at the event
- Lightning talk slot
- Video interview with Sponsor shared via social media (Platinum)

We invited partners that we have worked with previously, and also new partners related to the event themes and audience. 
We also added a `sign-up form <https://forms.gle/Y46d4ZaUMMVVStAs7>`_ on the website for interested sponsors to contact us via.

We were delighted that `F1000 Research <https://f1000research.com/>`_, `Figshare <https://figshare.com/>`_ and `eLife <https://elifesciences.org/>`_ joined us again as Silver sponsors, and `Wellcome <https://wellcome.org/>`_ joined us as a Platinum partner. 
Representatives from the sponsoring organisations engaged with the programme through our Steering Committee, lightning talks, and Hack Day judging. 
Figshare also provided a `CW conference portal <https://ssi-cw.figshare.com/>`_ to capture and generate DOIs for the event outputs. 

Sponsorship allowed us to procure additional platforms to enhance our event (such as a premium `GatherTown <https://www.gather.town/>`_ subscription to facilitate the quiz within our social programme, `Sli.do <https://www.sli.do/>`_ professional for audience Q&A and engagement), pay for speaker fees and gifts, and offer more financial assistance to participants. 

A lesson learned with regards to sponsorship, is to include in the sponsorship packages whether or not they are inclusive of VAT to help manage expectations. 
We also learned that timelines for delivering benefits should be included on sponsorship package items to mitigate against the risk of a lot of benefits needing to be implemented at the last minute (e.g. due to partnerships secured close to the event date).
