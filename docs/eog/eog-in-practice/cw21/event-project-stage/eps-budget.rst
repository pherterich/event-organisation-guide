CW21 Budget
============

As we were planning for the event to be virtual from the beginning, we were able to budget for our main expenses out of our expected income from registrations and sponsors.
We kept the registration fee at £50 (or £25 for access to a single day) to ensure we could cover the costs of prizes (which are a CW tradition) and live transcription and captioning which would be new for our event.
We estimated that there would be around 100 registrations, and that we would have two or three Silver sponsors. 
As we began to receive more :ref:`sponsorship <cw21-eps-sponsorship>`, we were able to make decisions on additional costs such as procuring additional platforms to enhance our event as well as offering more financial assistance to participants. 

Any profit that is made from CW allows the SSI to fund special collaborators and sponsor other events and activities.
