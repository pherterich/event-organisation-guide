CW21 Event Safety 
===================

Ahead of the event, we attended a `Zoom safety drill hosted by the CSCCE <https://www.cscce.org/2021/04/06/new-resource-addresses-virtual-event-security-and-dealing-with-zoom-bombing/>`_ to test out the various security features available on Zoom, and to role play what it would be like to have to report and evict a bad actor and then deal with the fallout.
The security features within Zoom make it easy to stop everything in order to eject a bad actor, but this can be quite jarring and disruptive for participants (and traumatising to those targeted by the bad actor) so ensuring a safe environment for participants from the start is of utmost importance.
A Code of Conduct mandates standards of behaviour and interaction expected from organisers and participants.


Code of Conduct 
-----------------

The Code of Conduct was provided as a set of documents:

- The Code of Conduct itself: `CW21 Code of Conduct <https://software.ac.uk/cw21/participation-guidelines#code-of-conduct>`_  
- How to report a violation: the `CW21 Attendee Procedure for Reporting Harassment <https://software.ac.uk/cw21/participation-guidelines/harassment-reporting-procedure>`_
- How the Code of Conduct committee will handle harassment reports: the `CW21 Staff Procedure For Handling Reported Harassment <https://software.ac.uk/cw21/participation-guidelines/staff-procedure-handling-reported-harassment>`_

All of these materials were made available within the `CW21 Participation Guidelines <https://software.ac.uk/cw21/participation-guidelines>`_ which participants had to have read and agreed to abide by at registration, and were reminded of throughout the event.
