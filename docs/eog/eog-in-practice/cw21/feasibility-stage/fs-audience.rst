CW21 Audience
=============================

The Collaborations Workshop series brings together researchers, developers, innovators, managers, funders, publishers, leaders and educators to explore best practices and the future of research software. 
As such, our main target audience includes changemakers, advocates and ambassadors of all career stages and identities for each of these stakeholder groups who will continue and build off of the conversation and collaborations beyond the workshop.
Our target audience comprises of people who can dedicate time to a three-day event as this will allow us to meet our :doc:`fs-goals-and-objectives`. 
By being multi-disciplinary, we can engage a wide range of people who can bring knowledge and skills back to their domains. 

The geographic location of the CW target audience is the UK/Europe. 
As CW21 will be online, the target audience's geographic location will not be limited except by time zone - participants in Europe, Africa and eastern timezones of North and South America are more likely to participate in a 10:00-16:00 BST event.
This will give us the opportunity to invite changemakers who would not normally be able to travel to the UK, and make the event more accessible.
We also aim to engage people in other timezones in the discussions through social media and sharing of outputs. 


Below we discuss specific audiences, communities and job roles to target related to the themes of CW21. We will encourage connections within these communities to reach out to their communities so that the recommendation/promotion comes from a trusted member and is more likely to be actioned.
