CW21 Date 
===========

The date needs to fit into the calendar of other events that are likely to affect the :ref:`cw21-fs-audience`. 
Things to consider here may include being outside of University term time and preferably not clashing with school holidays for those with caring responsibilities.
Bank holidays and religious holidays should also inform the decision.

The best dates for CW21 were Tuesday, 30 March to Thursday, 1 April 2021. 
For publicity and planning purposes, we noted that this was the first week of British Summer Time (BST).
