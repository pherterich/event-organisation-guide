CW20 Sponsorship
=================

As soon as we made the decision to move online, we contacted the event's sponsors to notify them and offer to renegotiate any previously agreed packages. 
We were extremely grateful that our sponsors `Microsoft <https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/index.html>`_, `F1000 Research <https://f1000research.com/>`_, `Figshare <https://figshare.com/>`_, `eLife <https://elifesciences.org/>`_ and `Overleaf <https://www.overleaf.com>`_ pledged their full support of the event moving online and also engaged with the programme through lightning talks, mini-workshops and Hack Day judging.
