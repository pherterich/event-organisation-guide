CW24 Sponsorship
=================

Ahead of CW23, the team set sponsorship packages of Silver, Gold and Platinum to £1500, £3000 and £6000 (+VAT). 
For CW24, we kept the sponsorship packages and their prizes from CW23 and highlighted that some of the benefits (such as steering committee membership or mini-workshop slots) could only be accommodated up to a certain date on the `CW24 Sponsorship page <https://www.software.ac.uk/cw24-sponsorship-packages>`_. 
For CW23, a la carte benefits were added in addition to the main packages. 
We kept those packages and adjusted the availability and costs for the Audio/Video Sponsor offering to account for the expected lower cost of delivering CW24 hybrid compared to CW23. 
The following a la carte benefits were offered.

- Accessibility and diversity fund (£1,000 each)
- Hack Day Prizes Sponsor (1 available - £4,000)
- Workshop Dinner Sponsor (1 available - £5,000)
- Audio/Video Sponsor (1 available - £7,000)

A la carte benefits were treated as donations and VAT was not charged for those. 
For future Collaborations Workshops, this should be made clear on the sponsorship web page and we also recommend having sponsorship agreements ready to facilitate getting sponsors on board.

Zoom Events also offered sponsorship tiers and virtual sponsor booths. 
We set up Zoom Events in March when our sponsors were already on board.  
As they wanted to focus their benefits on in-person interaction, we did not explore additional Zoom Events offerings for sponsors in further detail.

We invited partners that we have worked with previously using tailored emails. 
We also contacted new partners related to the event themes and audience through a mix of targeted emails where possible and requests using contact forms on websites. 
We offered a `sign-up form on the website <https://forms.gle/un8MsPKD3K1NKyBd9>`_ for interested sponsors to contact us.

We were delighted that the `Wellcome Trust <https://wellcome.org/>`_ joined us as a Platinum sponsor and `The Alan Turing Institute <https://www.turing.ac.uk/>`_ joined us as Gold Sponsor and also contributed to the accessibility and diversity fund. 

Sponsorship allowed us to provide a range of social events and increase our offering of financial assistance, especially supporting participants with childcare.
