CW24 Closing Down the Event Project Stage
==========================================


At the end of the event
-------------------------
As part of the eventâ€™s wrap up session, we made participants aware that we would be gathering feedback, following up with them about speed blogs and their prizes at the end of the event. 
We thanked the sponsors, volunteers, speakers and workshop facilitators for their contributions towards delivering the event and the SSI Director and Community Lead thanked the CW Chair for their excellent work in bringing everything together for an amazing event. 
We also highlighted the local support from venue staff for in-person support and helping with the technical set up to ensure remote participants can participate smoothly. 
Last but not least, we also thanked the participants for their engagement as without them the unconference would not have been a success.


After the event
-------------------------

We emailed participants with a form to collect feedback after the event. 

The CW24 organising team resumed their regular meetings for a few weeks to celebrate the successes, discuss the feedback and lessons learned, and ensure any post event tasks are taken care of in a timely manner.

We got in touch with Collaborative Ideas, Hack Day and feedback raffle winners to collect their mailing addresses and preferences on prizes. 
We then procured the vouchers and arranged for them to be sent to the winners and shipped Hack Day prizes to those that could not accept them in person.

We liaised with the venue to update purchase orders and arrange invoices to be paid and followed up on invoices for social events. 
We also made sure any reimbursement claims for financial assistance and speaker expenses were submitted in time to be processed before the end of the SSI3 grant.

In the months after the event, we followed up on the speed blogs that were produced as part of the Discussion session. 
We published them alongside news items about photos from the event being available and the session recordings being processed and published. 
You can see the details of the CW24 outputs in the :ref:_cw24-eps-outputs-and-outcomes and the timeline of when we made them available in the :ref:_cw24-eps-timeline.

When are you done?
-------------------------
When all of the outputs that we planned to produce are available (locations of which are mentioned in the section above), the event is complete.
