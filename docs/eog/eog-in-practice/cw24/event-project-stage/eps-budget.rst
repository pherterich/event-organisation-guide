CW24 Budget
============

We knew in advance that we would be operating CW24 at a loss, as the Institute decided to absorb the significant costs associated with the additional equipment and support required to make it a successful hybrid event and not pass these on to participants via the registration fee. 
We increased the registration fees slightly from CW24 to adjust for higher costs due to inflation. 
Remote participation was set at £75 (compared to £50 in 2023) and in-person participation at £300 (from £275 in 2023). 
We estimated that there would be around 120 registrations in total, and that we would have one or two sponsors.

As we began to receive sponsorship <cw24-eps-sponsorship>, we were able to support participants with child care costs and put money towards some in-person social events. 

Having a member of the SSI Finance team part of the core organising team as CW24 Finance Lead to support budget management and correct processes ahead of the end of SSI Phase 3 funding was invaluable.
