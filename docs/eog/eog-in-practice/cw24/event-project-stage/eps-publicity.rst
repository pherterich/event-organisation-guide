CW24 Publicity
===============


Before the event
--------------------
The visual identity of CW24 relied on the `new SSI branding guidelines <https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/introducing-new-ssi-branding>`_.
The CW24 logo provides an immediate recognition of the event and its association with the SSI. 
The official CW24 image depicting three lit light bulbs on a dark background was created using freely available stock images. 
It represents some of the themes and ideals behind CW24. All CW24 related social media posts were also accompanied by a light bulb emoji.

CW24 branding was used also on Zoom Events and YouTube to ensure current participants and future viewers would feel a sense of continuity between all CW24 communications efforts.

Our publicity plan can be found below. 
It lists all news items published to the Institute website for announcements such as registration opening, the call for submissions and financial assistance. 
These news items were then promoted via Twitter/X and LinkedIn, as well as emailed directly to the target :ref:`CW24 Audiences <cw24-fs-audience>`.

Ahead of registration closing, the team hosted a publicity sprint to collectively research additional audiences and organisations that could be contacted with overview information of the event and registration details.
  
During the event
--------------------

During the event, the Institute Communications Officer live-posted on X and LinkedIn using the #CollabW24 hashtag, the light bulb emoji, and branded images. 
This was done to engage community members who were unable to participate in the full programme but also those present that were keeping an eye on social media or live posting themselves. 
Among the content shared were the keynote livestreams and the panel discussion.


After the event
--------------------

After the event, we promoted the Code for Thought `episode reporting on the event <https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/1326658/15045013-en-collaborations-workshop-2024>`_ as well as the `blog post written <https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/research-it-collaborations-workshop-2024>`_ by members of the University of Manchester Research IT team about the event. 
We also published a news item announcing the availability of the session recordings and photos from the event to the Institute website. 
All publicity items were then promoted via LinkedIn as the `Instituteâ€™s X account was unavailable <https://www.software.ac.uk/news/ssi-x-account-unavailable>`_.

In addition to the above content which we had to create, we also expected to publish a number of speed blog posts from the Discussion session groups to the Institute website. 
To make them easy to find, we have tagged them as `CW24 <https://www.software.ac.uk/search/node?keys=CW24>`_ and `speed blog posts <https://www.software.ac.uk/search/node?keys=Speed%20blog%20posts>`_ and have also promoted them via social media, tagging the authors who provided handles.
