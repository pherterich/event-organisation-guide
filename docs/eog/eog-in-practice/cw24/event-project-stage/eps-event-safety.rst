CW24 Event Safety 
===================

To avoid any people that were not registered joining any of the Zoom sessions, we restricted registration for Zoom Events to the email addresses that were used for registration. 
We then offered attendees the option to add an additional email address that they preferred to use for Zoom by contacting the helpdesk channel on Slack or emailing a shared email address. 

We asked participants not to share publicly any links to the Zoom Events, Slack channel or collaborative note-taking documents.

At the start of each day, we reminded attendees of the `participation guidelines <https://www.software.ac.uk/cw24-participation-guidelines>`_ which highlighted the event’s social media policy and guidance on intellectual property and provided reassurance to attendees around their rights and responsibilities, especially in the interactive sessions that created novel content.


Code of Conduct 
-----------------
To ensure a safe environment for participants, we had a Code of Conduct in place to set out standards of behaviour and interaction expected from all participants. 
The Code of Conduct consisted of the following documents:

- The `Code of Conduct <https://www.software.ac.uk/cw24-participation-guidelines>`_
- The `Attendee Procedure for Reporting Harassment <https://www.software.ac.uk/cw24-attendee-procedure-reporting-harassment>`_
- The `Staff Procedure For Handling Reported Harassment <https://www.software.ac.uk/cw24-staff-procedure-handling-reported-harassment>`_

All of these materials were made available within the CW24 Participation Guidelines which participants had to have read and agreed to abide by at registration. 
Attendees were reminded of the CW24 Participation guidelines throughout the event.

Health and Safety policy
-----------------
Following CW23’s example and discussion with the steering committee, we decided to have an explicit Health and Safety policy for in-person attendees. 
In-person participants were strongly encouraged to take a COVID-19 and flu test before travelling to CW24. 

Furthermore, free lateral flow antigen tests were provided to registered participants attending CW24 in-person and anyone exhibiting symptoms or testing positive for COVID-19 or flu was asked not to attend in person. 

Masks and social distancing were optional, but we provided disposable medical face masks and operated a traffic light badging system that allowed participants to signal if they were not comfortable with close interaction and contact.

No cases of COVID-19 or flu were reported at or following CW24.
