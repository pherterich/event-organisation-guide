CW24 Agenda
============

For in-person CWs, the days are long to maximise the opportunities for networking, collaboration, discussions, and solving problems across the research software landscape. 
We kept this for the hybrid event to allow in-person participants to make the most of the event and made sure there were regular breaks in the agenda that allowed remote participants to step away from their devices and manage their Zoom fatigue.

Informing sessions
-------------
Keynote talks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We scheduled three keynote sessions (30 min each) to allow for one keynote speaker per theme (Environmental Sustainability, AI/ML tools for science, and Citizen Science).

Speakers were recommended by the Steering Committee and were contacted by the Event Chair prior to the event for their preferred slot and general availability to present in-person or remotely. 
Closer to the event, they were informed about logistics with regards to their presentation including Zoom Events links for those presenting remotely and availability to test the technical set up for in-person presenters.

Keynotes were set up as Webinars in Zoom Events which ensured only the speakers could talk during the session thus removing the need to monitor potential background noise from attendees unmuting and spotlight speakers. 
The talks were recorded and live streamed to YouTube (due to technical issues, we did not stream the first keynote but managed to check our set up to ensure the other keynotes were streamed live).

SSI Fellows were asked to chair the keynote sessions. 
They introduced the speakers, reminded attendees to submit any questions to sli.do, and kept an eye on time. 
They also facilitated the Q&A by relaying the most popular questions (sli.do includes a functionality to vote for questions) to the speaker.

The collaborative notes documents contained links to the speakers' slides and a section to take shared notes as the talk was happening.

Lightning talks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All presenters were asked to submit their one slide for their `lightning talk <https://www.software.ac.uk/cw24-lightning-talks>`_ ahead of time to the CW24 Zenodo community. 

We compiled all the slides into a single slide show to maximise efficiency during the session and added a 2 minute timer to each slide (using the `Slides Timer <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/slides-timer/nfhjdkmpebifdelclimjfaackjhiglpc>`_ Chrome extension), visible to the speakers and help them to keep on time. 
The Event Chair shared them via Screen Share in Zoom to remote attendees and participants in the room. 
The Session Chair gave a brief introduction to the session and then called up lightning talk speakers to give their talk, handing them the microphone if they presented in-person and asking them to unmute if they were presenting remotely.
The order of the talks was assigned randomly and was published in the shared notes document and `on the website <https://www.software.ac.uk/cw24-lightning-talks>`_ ahead of the sessions.

The lightning talk session does not include a Q&A, however, the collaborative notes document provided links to the slides for attendees to follow up as well as a section to take notes and ask questions to the speakers. 
Slack was also available to follow up on lightning talk presentations. 

You can watch the recordings of `Lightning talks session 1 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX-oN0f9KwM>`_ and `session 2 here on YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TdU12xFY7I>`_.
                                                                                                                                        
Exploring sessions
-------------

Panel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As the themes AI/ML tools in science and Citizen Research both overlap with Environmental Sustainability and it is one of the upcoming SSI focus areas, we decided to also host a panel that will bring some of the discussions around the themes together. 
The panel titled “The Digital Footprint Revolution: A Call to Action for Sustainable Research Computing” was 60 minutes in length and hybrid with 2 panellists discussing in person and 2 panellists joining remotely. 
Panellists were asked to introduce themselves and provide a summary of their work in the sustainable computing space (using slides where desired). 
The panel met ahead of the event to discuss what each panellist wanted to highlight and bring to the discussion, as well as to come up with a set of pre-prepared questions.

The Chair facilitated the discussion using a mix of the pre-prepared questions and questions submitted by participants via Sli.do.

You can view the `panel recording on YouTube here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhSqtsNVki0&list=PLpX1jXuNTXGqLDdkN_faZO6w-zT-K93sA&index=5>`_.

Discussion Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The `Discussion session <https://www.software.ac.uk/cw24-discussion-session-and-collaborative-ideas>`_ allows groups of people to discuss a topic that interests them in a way that furthers our knowledge of that topic. 
This session is a fundamental part of the Collaborations Workshop: it helps people learn about new ideas and work together on solving shared problems. 
The output of the discussion session is a `speed blog post <https://www.software.ac.uk/guide/speed-blogging-and-tips-writing-speed-blog-post>`_ from each group to help disseminate the insights to the wider community.

Participants suggested and signed up to the topics that they wanted to discuss in a spreadsheet in the lead up to the session. 
We were able to reuse the setup from CW23 which adapted the spreadsheet for a hybrid event by pre-assigning Group IDs (letters of the alphabet and a fruit as `introduced in 2021 <https://event-organisation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/eog/eog-in-practice/cw21/event-project-stage/eps-agenda.html#discussion-groups>`_) to spaces, each with an in-person location and an associated Zoom breakout room. 
We asked remote participants to include "(R)" at the end of their names when they signed up to discussion topics. 
We assessed the groups as they formed and assigned hybrid groups to in-person spaces that were set up for hybrid group work, groups that were in-person discussants only to large spaces that were set up for in-person group work and groups that had remote participants only to zoom breakout rooms.
The groups were directed to their discussion group reporting document via the “Groups” tab in the spreadsheet, in which they worked together on their speed blog posts.

Collaborative Ideas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Collaborative Ideas session is used to get people talking about their work. 
They identify problems within research software and come up with a solution, usually a project that can be taken forward to the CW Hack Day.

The session was facilitated in a similar way to the Discussion session except that the group assignments for the breakout rooms were randomly generated ahead of the event. We used information provided as part of the registration to create groups that have a good diversity of genders, disciplines and professional roles. 
We ended up with 8 hybrid groups, 6 in-person groups, and 1 remote group. 
Group Names were based on birds, so the group that was assigned to breakout room “Albatross” retrieved their Collaborative Ideas document for Group Name Albatross in the associated spreadsheet, and so on.

Voting for collaborative ideas was facilitated through a Google Form. 
It offered an overview of all ideas that were created throughout the session with links to the collaborative ideas documents for further detail. 
Participants were asked to fill the form once to vote and not for their own group. 
Every person had three votes that they could allocate to one, two or three different ideas via picking their favourite idea from a drop down menu for each vote. 
We scheduled a dedicated session to introduce the voting and provide people with some time to read through all ideas and make their decision. 
The voting form was open for 90 minutes after which the votes were tallied in time for the wrap up session that included a ceremony awarding prizes to the top three ideas. 
Prizes were `love2shop <https://www.love2shop.co.uk/>`_ gift cards of various values (£30 for 1st, £20 for 2nd, £10 for 3rd place) or an international equivalent that can be procured through the University of Edinburgh.

Creating

Hack Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CW24 concluded with the Hack Day, where teams formed to work on projects generated during the Collaborative Ideas session and other ideas pitched during the course of the event.

Hack Day project pitches and team formation took place at the end of Day 2. 
In the session, the organisers gave an overview of the logistics and gave some tips for technical choices, project management etc. 
Participants then took turns promoting a project to attract potential team members. 
Following the pitches, breakout rooms on Zoom were opened for teams to form around the proposed projects and the breakout rooms were mapped to a physical location in the venue for in-person people to discuss. 
Many of the Hack Day projects came from the Collaborative Ideas session. 
A spreadsheet was used for teams to register their projects and members, assign Zoom breakout rooms, in-person spaces that were set up for hybrid group work, and Slack channels, as well as collect project repositories.

One Zoom meeting was used to facilitate the Hack Day, with one breakout room created for each team, one for the judges, and a few extra side rooms to give teams the opportunity to split up and have side meetings. 
We had 10 teams working in 9 hybrid group working spaces in the venue (two smaller teams shared one of the big meeting rooms) and one room for the judges that carried out all visits to teams remotely (one judge was remote for at least part of the day). 
The judges posted visiting schedules on Slack to allow teams to plan for their visits and ensure they managed to take breaks. 
A general lunch break was encouraged when food was served for in-person attendees.

At the end of the Hack Day, each team had five minutes to demonstrate their projects and how they met the judging criteria:

1. Novelty, creativity, ‘coolness’ and/or usefulness
2. Implementation and infrastructure
3. Demo and presentation
4. Project transparency
5. Future potential
6. Team work

The order of teams was randomised and announced at short notice to make sure none of the teams could rely on additional time to prepare their presentation. 
Presentations were timed using Zoom’s timer app. 

After the presentations, the judges went into their physical room and breakout room to deliberate. 
The judges then returned and announced the top three teams which were awarded prizes. We ordered six of the following prizes to have at the event and procured the rest of the prizes after the event for the remaining winners.

1. `Anker 737 Power Bank (PowerCore 24K) <https://www.anker.com/products/a1289?ref=naviMenu&variant=41974285041814>`_
2. `Anker SOLIX PS30 Portable Solar Panel <https://www.anker.com/products/a24261a1?ref=naviMenu_pps&variant=42656753549462>`_  
3. `Anker Nano Power Bank (30W, Built-In USB-C Cable) <https://www.anker.com/products/a1259-built-in-cable-power-bank-10000mah>`_ 

Teaching
-------------
Mini-workshops and Demos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Mini-workshops and demo sessions will give an in-depth look at a particular project, tool or approach related to the CW24 themes and a chance to query developers and experts about how this might apply to participants' areas of work.

For CW24, we scheduled two 60 minute sessions and asked for submissions for 30 or 60 minute sessions. 
We planned for 4 parallel sessions as that’s what the rooms we hired could accommodate and assuming an equal spread across sessions, would result in about 30 participants for each workshop allowing them to be interactive. 
We had an open call for submissions for mini-workshops and demo sessions and reviewed them with the help of some sponsors and steering committee members using the following criteria:

- Relevance to the CW24 themes Environmental sustainability, AI/ML tools in science, Citizen Science
- Preference towards more general workshops to maximise interest to participants 
- Preference towards workshops that have some level of interactivity (versus just a presentation) and have described how they will facilitate interaction with both in-person and remote participants. 
- Clear aims, objectives and use of time
- Bonus points if the session can lead into a Hack Day activity
- Preference towards new voices/topics that have not been presented at a recent Collaborations Workshop
- Preference towards SSI Fellows' activities that have not been presented at a recent Collaborations Workshop

Using that approach we selected 7 proposals (one slot was part of the Platinum sponsor package) and offered unsuccessful proposers a lightning talk slot.

A few weeks before the event, we offered a facilitator guidance session where we provided an overview of logistics and set-up for the rooms, explained what support was in place and gave facilitators the opportunity to ask questions to ensure they were equipped to prepare collaborative sessions that worked well for both in-person, remote attendees and presenters.

Mini-workshops were set up as parallel sessions in Zoom Events which meant that each workshop had its own Zoom room and allowed for recording and breakout rooms within the sessions if required. 
We generated templated Google Docs for each session that the facilitators were empowered to adapt for their use. 
We also provided Sli.do sessions on request. 

Networking
-------------
Hybrid coffee chats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To encourage some dedicated connection between in-person and remote attendees, we hosted a 30 minute long hybrid coffee chat ahead of each day. 
The chats were hosted in a dedicated Zoom room highlighted in the sessions on Zoom Events and facilitated by SSI staff. 
In-person attendees were encouraged to join the session to introduce themselves or say ‘Hi!’ to remote attendees; free SSI t-shirts and hoodies were placed in the room to encourage in person attendees to come in and collect one and meet online attendees.  
The use of a meeting OWL made for a more interactive experience when we ran the session a second time on day two. 

Climbing session (in-person only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The evening before the event, we offered a `climbing taster session at the local climbing centre <https://warwick.ac.uk/services/sport/climbing/learn-to-climb/>`_. 
The one hour session was supported by instructors and included all equipment. 
Due to Health and Safety requirements, all participants had to fill a registration form ahead of the session. 
We managed sign-up through a Google Form sent through Eventbrite to attendees ahead of the event to ensure enough instructors were available and all participants were aware of the registration requirements. 

Workshop dinner (in-person only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To provide additional networking opportunities, we hosted a formal workshop dinner at the end of Day 1. 
Dinner was included for all in-person attendees that registered for the full event. 

Dinner was a three course menu served at long tables to facilitate conversations. 
Table assignments were done using the same script that created diverse collaborative ideas groups to try and bring people from a variety of institutions, disciplines, and roles together.

Guided campus tour (in-person only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As days during Collaborations Workshop are long and require a lot of sitting in rooms, we offered a guided campus tour after the main programme of Day 1 and before the workshop dinner. 
Walks have been popular social activities at previous in-person CWs as attendees seem to enjoy the low intensity exercise, mingle with other attendees and the opportunity to catch some fresh air.

With the help from our local steering committee, we booked two campus guides through Warwick Welcome services that took groups of around 8 people each for a tour around campus.

Self-guided walks (in-person only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
University of Warwick Art Collection offers `materials to explore the university campus <https://warwick.ac.uk/services/art/sculpturepark/sculpture/>`_ and its art. 
Before the start of Day 2 of CW24 we offered attendees printed versions of the `Springtime Trail <https://warwick.ac.uk/services/art/sculpturepark/sculpture/springtime_trail.pdf>`_ map and the `Connections Trail booklet <https://warwick.ac.uk/services/art/sculpturepark/familyfun/connections_trail_2023.pdf>`_ to explore the campus further in their own time.
