CW24 Venue and Catering
===============

Venue
-------------
We hosted the in-person aspect of CW24 at the University of Warwick (Scarman) which met most of the venue requirements set out in the `venue specifications <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4315117>`_ that were created based on running Collaborations Workshops 2013 to 2019 in person.

At the University of Warwick (Scarman), we hired the following set of rooms:
  
- A tiered lecture theatre for all plenary sessions and one of the parallel mini-workshop sessions (100 - 120 people capacity)
- 3 large rooms (1 boardroom style, 20 people capacity; 2 cabaret style, 30 - 35 people capacity) to host parallel mini-workshop sessions and smaller discussion groups
- 8 smaller meeting rooms (boardroom style, 8-10 people capacity) to host discussion and Hack Day groups
- 1 room offering informal seating for about 8 people that was offered as quiet room to participants 

Aside from the quiet room, all rooms were set up with equipment (OWLs or other cameras and microphones) to support interactive hybrid sessions.

Catering
-------------
Refreshment breaks were served in the Scarman lounge, a shared space with other events that were hosted at the venue. 
The lounge provided a varied range of seating as well as an outdoor space. Lunches and dinners were provided in the venue's restaurant that was hired to allow private dining for the workshop dinner.

Water, coffee and tea (inc. non-dairy milk options) and snacks were available at all times throughout the day and the venue catered for dietary requirements and allergies. 

Workshop dinner
-------------
The workshop dinner was in the same dining room as other meals but people seemed to appreciate the more formal set up and the waiter service. 
Alongside water, we offered white and red wine for dinner.

We pre-selected a three course menu ahead of time from the venueâ€™s offering. 
Waiters checked with each attendee for allergies and preferences on the night.
