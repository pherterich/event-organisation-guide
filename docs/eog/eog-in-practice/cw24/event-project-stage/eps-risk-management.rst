CW24 Risk Management  
=====================

For CW24, we looked at the following risk aspects:

- The main stakeholder and funder (the Software Sustainability Institute)
- The organising team
- Other stakeholders (sponsors, keynote speakers, attendees, Session Chairs, volunteers/helpers at the event)
- Event agenda
- Venue
- Infrastructure

To keep on top of risks and mitigation strategies, we created a `risk register <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4315012>`_ that kept track of risks and was a central resource for all organising team members.

The main stakeholder and funder
--------------------

The risks that we identified and needed to mitigate relating to the main stakeholder - in this case the Software Sustainability Institute - were:

- Event goals and objectives not aligned with the main stakeholder goals
- Damage to the main stakeholder’s reputation

We were able to build on experience from CW23 which demonstrated that a hybrid event can deliver on the event goals and objectives. 
To ensure that the CW24 Goals and Objectives aligned with the main stakeholder goals, the Director was consulted during the CW24 Feasibility Stage and kept updated throughout the project stage.

Building on an internationally recognised expertise in running successful remote events and a successful hybrid CW23, it was expected that a hybrid CW24 would not damage the Institute’s recommendation and instead make the team leading experts in hybrid events. 
The organising team made sure they were aware of aspects that could be improved compared to CW23 and kept consulting and learning from other hybrid events in the community to ensure CW24 would be a successful event to close out the Institute’s third funding phase.

Feedback from respondents to the CW24 feedback survey showed that this was successful as half of the attendees that provided feedback considered CW24 the best event (of at least 3) they attended in the previous 12 months and only 9.4% of respondent’s rated CW24 average.

The organising team
--------------------
In previous years, Collaborations Workshop was organised by an individual and moving to a bigger organising team was already a step to reduce the risk of all knowledge being dependent on one key person. 
However, we still identified the following risk:

- Core team member falling ill/becoming unavailable for a longer period

Our mitigation strategy included having weekly meetings to ensure the wider team was aware of updates and priorities. 
Furthermore, we encouraged all work to be documented on the shared drive and GitHub to make it easy for other team members to step in and take over if required. 
For future events, we also recommend a shared email address or similar to make sure queries and conversations with people outside the organising team are accessible and transparent.

Other stakeholders 
--------------------

Sponsors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With regards to sponsors,we identified the risk of having no or not enough sponsors.

To mitigate the financial risk of no or not enough sponsorship, we made sure our budget and costing of registration took no sponsorship into account. 
To address reputational risks of not having sponsors for the event, we made sure we dedicated a significant amount of time to contacting potential partners with tailored messages that highlighted the benefits of sponsoring the event.

Attendees
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With regards to attendees, the following risk was identified:

- Not enough people registering (in-person)
- Too many attendees

We mitigated not having enough registrations by ensuring the event is promoted widely. 
Furthermore, we monitored registrations and the budget closely and ensured we regularly communicated with the venue to understand financial implications of varying registration numbers.

We managed too many attendees by limiting the number of in-person tickets available through registration to ensure we stay within room capacity and overflow options we planned for.

Keynote speakers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Risks that we identified around keynote speakers included a speaker not being able to attend last minute or technical issues affecting the presentation. 
We mitigated this by being in regular contact with the speakers, providing details around the technical setup used and offering trial sessions. 
Should one of the speakers not have been available any longer, we would have asked them to record their talk if possible.

Mini-workshop and demo session facilitators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With regards to mini-workshop and demo session facilitators, the risk we identified was that they were not available to present or technical issues for remote attendees and presenters. 
We mitigated this by encouraging facilitators to think about the interactivity of their workshop which led to many workshops being led by more than one person which reduced the risk of all facilitators becoming unavailable. 
The facilitator training we provided helped mini-workshop hosts to prepare their sessions and think about any issues that might arrive throughout their session. 
We provided staff support to help with technical issues throughout the session.

Volunteers/helpers at the event
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The main risk identified with regards to volunteers/helpers at the event was that we might not have enough of them. 
We mitigate this by assigning a back up to each of the event roles in the duty roster. 
For future events, this could furthermore be mitigated by recruiting helpers not only from SSI staff, but the wider community. 
However, this will require additional coordination and training time.

Event agenda
--------------------
The risks we identified regarding the agenda were:

- Not enough good quality submissions for mini-workshops (ahead of the event)
- Social activities are not attended or unsuccessful
- Not enough breaks

In the lead up to the event, we ensured we communicated the call for submissions widely to ensure good contributions. 
If required, we considered offering an extension to submission deadlines and support from the Event Chair (e.g. a webinar or drop-in session) to transform ideas into sessions that fit the interactive aspects of a Collaborations Workshop.

We were aware that Collaborations Workshops are very busy and full days. 
We planned regular breaks throughout the day and made it clear to attendees that they are invited to skip parts of the workshop to take additional breaks. 
We made a quiet room available that provided a dedicated space to recharge.

To scope social activities and interest into anything centrally organised, we sent a survey a few weeks ahead of the event to gather interest in the ideas, and help ourselves plan.

Venue
--------------------
The main risk we identified with regards to the venue was that the venue suddenly would become unavailable. 
We mitigated this through regular conversation with our contacts at the venue, being flexible about reducing the amount of in-person attendees if some rooms had become unavailable and should the venue have become fully unusable, we could have used the notes from `CW20 <https://event-organisation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/eog/eog-in-practice/cw20/cw20.html>`_ to move CW24 online.

Infrastructure
--------------------
The risks identified regarding infrastructure included:

- One of the platforms used becomes unavailable
- Network issues on the day
- Equipment breaking

We mitigated these risks by ordering additional equipment from the venue and working closely with their technical support team to ensure any hardware could be quickly replaced when needed. 
The venue provided two different networks (eduroam and a guest wifi) which meant we could switch if required. 
For the main platforms we used, we were aware of alternatives that we could switch to (e.g. Framapad or HackMD instead of GoogleDocs, GoogleMeet instead of Zoom).
