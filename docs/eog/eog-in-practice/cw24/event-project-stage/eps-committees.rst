Steering Committee
-------------------
The CW24 Steering Committee consisted mainly of SSI Fellows that volunteered after an open call for committee members with expertise in the workshop themes Environmental Sustainability, AI/ML tools for science, and Citizen Science. 
The committee was also joined by a local SSI contact and workshop sponsors.

The committee met three times (approximately every two months) from November 2023 to March 2024. 
During the meetings, the committee members helped to guide the agenda and direction of the workshop (recommending speakers and session types, reviewing submissions), provided advice for running the event (recommending ways to improve accessibility and networking) and contributed to many of the workshop sessions.

Code of Conduct Committee
--------------------------
The CW24 Code of Conduct (CoC) Committee consisted of four members who were Institute staff, the Event Chair and an external Steering Committee member. 
There was a mix of gender, race and career stage within the Committee to provide a range of options for participants to choose who they felt most comfortable reporting to.

Before the event, we sent the following to CoC Committee members to read through and raise any issues or questions:

- The `Code of Conduct <https://www.software.ac.uk/cw24-participation-guidelines>`_
- The `Attendee Procedure for Reporting Harassment <https://www.software.ac.uk/cw24-attendee-procedure-reporting-harassment>`_
- The `Staff Procedure For Handling Reported Harassment <https://www.software.ac.uk/cw24-staff-procedure-handling-reported-harassment>`_

All of these materials were made available within the `CW24 Participation Guidelines <https://www.software.ac.uk/cw24-participation-guidelines>`_ which participants had to have read and agreed to abide by at registration.

During the event, we had a private Slack channel in the CW24 Slack workspace for CoC Committee members in case any incidents arose. 
No misconduct was reported from CW24.
