CW24 Event Roles
=================

Before the event
-------------------
CW24 was the first Collaborations Workshop that was organised by a wider team and their roles are detailed in the Organising team section in :ref:`CW24 Committees <_cw24-eps-committees>`. 
:ref:`CW24 Timeline <_cw24-eps-timeline>` provides a detailed breakdown of tasks in the planning phase and when they took place.

During the event
-------------------

CW is the premier event of the Institute, so most staff were expected to attend and support additional roles required throughout the event. 
Institute Fellows and CW24 Sponsors filled remaining roles on the Code of Conduct Committee and Hack Day judging committee.

To prepare staff for roles ahead of the event, we built on roles from CW23 and updated the responsibilities to match the technical infrastructure and additional support provided by the venue. 
We asked staff to volunteer for roles according to their availability and interest, used a staff meeting to talk through roles and answer questions and demonstrate Zoom Events as the platform was used for the first time. 
Based on the information provided by staff, we created a duties roster spreadsheet that assigned staff to sessions and roles.
