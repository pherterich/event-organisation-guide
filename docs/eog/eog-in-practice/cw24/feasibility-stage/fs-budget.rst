CW24 Budget
===========

The main budget items for a hybrid CW24 were assumed to be: 

- Venue hire
- Catering
- Registrations, travel and accommodation for invited speakers, Steering Committee members, and other key invitees
- Eventbrite fee
- Prizes for First, Second and Third place Collaborative Ideas groups
- Prizes for First, Second and Third place Hack Day teams
- Prizes for Feedback raffle
- Audio/Visual equipment and support (we expected to reuse hardware purchased for CW23 but depending on the venue, additional items and support were required)
- Financial assistance for participants

Some of these costs could be covered by income from registrations (estimated registration cost £300 for in-person participation and £75 for remote participation) and sponsorship. 
This registration fee is a slight increase from previous years (£275 in-person, £50 remote) to balance between the ongoing cost of living crisis and price inflation. 
The professional audio/visual services were expected to be a significant cost for a hybrid event. 
We anticipated delivering CW24 within budget considering that some costs are allocated to the event within the SSI3 budget to ensure not all of the costs needed to be passed on to participants.

Additional Costs
 - SSI Staff registration, travel and accommodation costs  
 - SSI Fellows registration, travel and accommodation costs  

   - Due to SSI Phase 3 funding coming to an end in May 2024, we could not cover costs for all Fellows as per CW23. A certain budget (based on remaining available funds in the grant allocated to Fellows activities) was set for Fellows to attend and was allocated on a “first come, first serve” basis.
