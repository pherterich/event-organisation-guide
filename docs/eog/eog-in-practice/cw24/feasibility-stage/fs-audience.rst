CW24 Audience
=============================

The Collaborations Workshop series brings together researchers, developers, innovators, managers, funders, publishers, leaders and educators to explore best practices and the future of research software. 
As such, our main target audience included changemakers, advocates and ambassadors of all career stages and identities for each of these stakeholder groups who will continue and build on the conversation and collaborations beyond the workshop. 
Our target audience comprises people who can dedicate time to a two to three working day event as this will allow us to meet our goals and objectives. 
By being multi-disciplinary, we could engage a wide range of people who can bring knowledge and skills back to their areas of work. 

The geographic location of the CW target audience is the UK/Europe. 
As CW24 was hybrid, the target audience's geographic location was not limited except by time zone - participants in Europe, Africa and eastern time zones of North and South America were more likely to participate remotely in a UK-working day event. 
This allowed us to continue to provide the opportunity to invite changemakers who would not normally be able to travel to the UK, and make the event more accessible. 
We also aimed to engage people in other timezones in the discussions through social media and sharing of outputs.
Below we discuss specific audiences, communities and job roles to target related to the themes of CW21. 
We will encourage connections within these communities to reach out to their communities so that the recommendation/promotion comes from a trusted member and is more likely to be actioned.

The typical number of participants at CWs in the past have been 80-90 for in-person CWs and 90-110 for online CWs. 
The number of participants needed to be capped to ensure equitable participation for both types of attendee and limitations set by the venue, and an initial estimate was to facilitate 90-100 in-person and 30-40 remote participants, i.e. a total of 120-140 participants. 
Any potential lower limit on the number of in-person participants (e.g. through another spike in COVID infections or similar) before de-scoping/cancelling the in-person element of the event and moving fully online could have been set during the Event Project Stage as part of the risk management around participants and the venue.  

In general, the following audiences were targeted as CW24 participants.
 - (All stakeholders)

Below we discuss specific additional audiences, communities and job roles to target related to the themes of CW24. 
We encouraged our connections within these communities to reach out to their community members so that the recommendation/promotion came from a trusted member and was more likely to be actioned.

Environmental Sustainability
--------------------
The theme encompassed how to determine the environmental impact of your hardware and code, training and education about environmentally sustainable behaviour, and activism highlighting potential improvements to existing infrastructure, processes and systems.

(Additional) Stakeholders to target with focus on this theme: 
- Science activists

Example communities

- `Green Algorithms <https://www.green-algorithms.org/>`_
- `Digital Humanities Climate Coalition <https://digitalhumanities-uk-ie.org/community-interest-groups/digital-humanities-climate-coalition/>`_


AI/ML tools for science
--------------------
The theme encompassed benefits and limitations of using AI/ML tools to write your code, ethical considerations when using these tools, and training and education around the usage and impact of AI/ML tools.

Stakeholders to target with focus on this theme: 
- Ethicists

Example communities

- `JUST AI <https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/just-ai/>`_
- `Responsible AI UK <https://www.rai.ac.uk/>`_


Citizen science
--------------------
The theme encompassed designing participatory research projects, training and education around citizen science, and the role of research software in citizen science projects.

Stakeholders to target with focus on this theme: 
 - Educators
 - Volunteer contributors


Example communities

- `Eu-citizen.science <https://eu-citizen.science/>`_, especially their ambassadors
- `LIBER Citizen Science Working Group <https://libereurope.eu/working-group/liber-citizen-science-working-group/>`_
