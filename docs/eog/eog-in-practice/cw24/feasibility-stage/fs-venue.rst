CW24 Venue
===========
CW24 was planned as a hybrid event.  

In-person
--------------------
CW23 was hosted in Manchester to allow the CW23 Event Chair to be nearby to help with the organisation. 
For CW24, we investigated a range of venues and options located centrally in the UK and thus easy to travel to (Midlands, London) or located in Oxford and thus easy to access by the logistic leads. 
We carried out in-person visits to the University of Warwick and St. Anneâ€™s College, Oxford to understand if those venues might meet our needs for CW24 as laid out in the specification of venue requirements.
 
The University of Warwick (Scarman) met most of the requirements set out, thus we decided to host the in-person aspect of CW24 there even if it carried an additional risk as none of the core team members was close to regularly carry out venue visits to help with the organisation.

Remote
--------------------
Ideally we wanted to build off of the success and lessons learned from CW20-CW22 (online) and the hybrid CW23 and use platforms that we gained experience and expertise with such as Zoom and Slack. 
We decided to explore other platforms for remote participation and networking more thoroughly in the Event Project Stage.

Regardless of the online platform, we needed good quality AV recording and broadcasting to remote participants. 
For smaller rooms, this assumed this to be covered by the Technical Leads. 
We considered hiring an AV company to assist with the technical setup for sessions in the main room.
