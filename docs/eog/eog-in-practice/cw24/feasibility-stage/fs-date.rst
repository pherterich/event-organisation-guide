CW24 Date 
===========

The date needed to fit into the calendar of other events that are likely to affect the :ref:`cw24-fs-audience`. 
Things to consider included the date being outside of University term time and preferably not clashing with school holidays for those with caring responsibilities. 
Bank holidays and religious holidays also informed the decision as well as SSI Phase 3 funding (`EP/S021779/1 <https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FS021779%2F1#>`_) coming to an end in May 2024. 

After checking against holidays and other events important to the community, the following dates were in contention: 
 - February 27th-29th 2024 (Tu-Thu)
 - April 23rd-25th 2024 (Tu-Thu)
 - April 30th-May 2nd 2024 (Tu-Thu).

To allow for more time to organise the event to a high standard, the organising team preferred one of the April date options and following the availability of a suitable venue, we decided to host CW24 from Tuesday, 30 April to Thursday, 2 May 2024.
