CW24 Goals and Objectives
=============================

What we hope to achieve by running the event (goals) and a set of measurable steps towards achieving our goals (objectives).

Themes
--------------------

Goals
 - Increase confidence and understanding of key topics for the research software community that also fit into the wider aims and goals of the Institute.
 - Increase research software community wellbeing and care.


Objectives
 - Participants will discuss topics related to the themes Environmental Sustainability, AI/ML tools for science, and Citizen Science. At the end of the event, they will be able to:

   - Environmental Sustainability: 
     - Understand how to determine the environmental impact of your hardware and code.
     - Identify training and education about environmentally sustainable behaviour.
     - Support activism highlighting potential improvements to existing infrastructure, processes and systems.

   - AI/ML tools for science: 
     - Understand the benefits and limitations of using AI/ML tools to write your code.
     - Identify ethical considerations when using these tools.
     - Identify training and education around the usage and impact of AI/ML tools.

   - Citizen science: 
     - Analyse participatory research projects.
     - Identify training and education around citizen science.
     - Understand the role of research software in citizen science projects.
        
 - Promote the Institute's goals and activities related to the theme of Environmental Sustainability such as the CW23 hack day project `Climate-Aware Task Scheduler <https://github.com/GreenScheduler/cats>`_ and recent `discussions around the environmental impact of research computing <https://software.ac.uk/blog/2023-08-15-tracking-environmental-impact-research-computing>`_. 
 - Promote the Institute's goals and activities related to the theme of AI/ML tools for science such as introductory training `on Machine Learning with Scikit Learn and Python <https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/machine-learning-novice-sklearn>`_ and `Making machine learning in research reproducible <https://software.ac.uk/blog/2023-02-13-how-increase-citations-ease-reviews-and-facilitate-collaboration-ml-applied-science>`_ as well as `recent discussions on how AI and LLMs might change the role of RSEs <https://software.ac.uk/blog/2023-08-17-how-will-advances-generative-ai-and-large-language-models-aid-software>`_. 
 - Promote the Institute's goals and activities related to the theme of Citizen Science such as relevant `Code for Thought episodes <https://software.ac.uk/news/new-code-thought-episode-citizen-science-and-software>`_ and `Homes Under the Microscope <https://homesunderthemicroscope.co.uk/>`_.
 - Relevant discussion topics related to the themes that are not discussed at CW24 can be brought into the SSI Fellow's Community Calls, Research Software Camps, and other Institute activities for further work.

Social
--------------------

Goals
 - Increase opportunities for participants to network, meet new people and start new collaborations. 
 - Bring together the research software community and our Fellows in-person and online.

Objectives
 - Dedicated networking session which is inclusive of both in-person and remote participants.
 - Have a mix of different types of networking and social activities to encompass the diversity of participant attitudes and preferences towards networking.
 - Participants to meet at least 7 new people.
 - Participants to establish at least 1 new collaboration.


Diversity
--------------------

Goals
 - Improve accessibility from the previous CW.
 - Increase diversity and representation from the previous CW (race, gender, career stage, role, location, etc.).
 - Increase opportunities for community members who are unable to attend to engage with the discussions.
 - Continue to show leadership in the way we run events and extend this to hybrid.
 - Explore how our community should do hybrid events, to show that there are ways of getting equitable participation, even if it is not an identical experience.


Objectives
 - Facilitate a hybrid event where the remote participants have an equally useful experience as in-person participants. 
 - Design sessions for equal access from remote and in-person participants.
 - Include closed captioning / transcription services.
 - Provide advice to participants on how to get the most out of a hybrid unconference.
 - Ensure at least 50% of the keynote speakers and plenary Session Chairs are women.
 - Increase representation of people from ethnic minorities above the previous CW.
 - Measure and compare the demographics between the previous two CWs.
 - Develop social media strategy to promote discussion topics which arise during the unconference to include and engage community members who are unable to attend (e.g. due to location or other commitments).
 - For at least 25% of (non SSI Fellow) attendees this should be their first CW.

Sponsorship
--------------------

Goals
 - Maintain relevance of sponsors to themes and audience.
 - Mitigate risk of losing sponsorship for future CWs. 

Objectives
 - Increase sponsorship compared to previous year (goal: Â£8000).
 - Reformulate sponsorship packages to account for hybrid event format and include more in-kind sponsorship options to engage sponsors for future partnership.
 - Target new sponsors compared to previous years (esp. at Silver and Gold level).
 - Invite sponsors from previous years to engage.

Technical
--------------------

Goals
 - Improve the documentation and infrastructure for running a CW as a hybrid event.

Objectives
 - Document process and lessons learned as we go along.
 - Successful use of AV and other services for inclusivity and equal access to the programme. 
 - Successful use of uCONFLY infrastructure (even if just by the organising team).
 - Explore new platforms for hybrid conference delivery and use platforms appropriate for the sessions and e.
 - Participants take skills, techniques, tools and resources back to their communities.
