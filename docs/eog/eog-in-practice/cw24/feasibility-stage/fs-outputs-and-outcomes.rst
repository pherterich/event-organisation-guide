CW24 Outputs and Outcomes 
==========================
Outputs are things produced during the workshop, be it physical or virtual, and outcomes are the changes made possible due to running the event. 
These should be linked to the event goals. Some of these will be the same as the objectives of the Workshop. 
They should include the type of resources that will be available after the event. 
That is, whether a report will be written, videos of the sessions or any other resources will be made available.

Outputs
--------------------
- Recordings of the sessions shared via the SSI Youtube channel
- Automated closed captioning and transcriptions
- Blog posts from the discussion session
- All slides and other outputs shared via the conference portal (e.g. Figshare) 
- Hack Day projects
- A highlights blog post on the SSI website
- A reflections blog post on the SSI website on how we implemented lessons learnt from CW23 to run CW24 as a hybrid event
- Collaborative notes documents and other unconference infrastructure resources shared
- Any sponsor outputs (e.g. Tweets, videos, etc.)
- Feedback into Event Organisation Guide (e.g. as an In Practice chapter)

The following outputs were aspirational as they require more effort from the team. 
They were likely to happen if CW24 ran at the end of February 2024, but with the event happening at the end of April 2024 these ended up getting dropped as the organising team moved on.  

- Collaborative Ideas to be recorded via https://github.com/softwaresaved/CW-ideas
- Manually checked captions and transcriptions

Outputs
--------------------
- Facilitation of new collaborations between participants
- Innovation within the domain of hybrid events
- Outputs are more widely shared, increasing impact of discussions and visibility of CW/SSI
- Increase in knowledge and confidence around the themes of the workshop by those who participated
- Increased accessibility and inclusion
- Community members who are unable to attend the event are still able to engage with the discussion
- Impact on hybrid events run by others
- Ease of running a hybrid CW again in the future
