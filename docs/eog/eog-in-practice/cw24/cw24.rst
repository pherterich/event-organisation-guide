The Collaborations Workshop (CW) is the annual flagship event of the `Software Sustainability Institute <www.software.ac.uk>`_ (SSI). It brings together researchers, developers, innovators, managers, funders, publishers, leaders, and educators with a focus on research software to explore and share best practice. 

Following a successful hybrid CW23, it was decided from the beginning that Collaborations Workshop 2024 (CW24) would be a hybrid event again to maintain accessibility of the event to people who were unable to attend in person and continue to innovate and trial within a hybrid event space to provide guidance and advice on running hybrid events to our community.

This In Practice write up covers how we organised CW24, following the steps in the `Feasibility Stage <https://event-organisation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/eog/feasibility-stage.html>`_ and the Event Project Stage of the SSIâ€™s Event Organisation Guide.

If you are interested in the experience of attending CW24 or history of CWs, the Code for Thought podcast released `an episode reporting on the event <https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/1326658/15045013-en-collaborations-workshop-2024>`_ and there was a `blog post written <https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/research-it-collaborations-workshop-2024>`_ by members of the University of Manchester Research IT team.
