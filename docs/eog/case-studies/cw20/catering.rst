CW20 Catering
=====================

After a discussion on 9 March 2020 with the local organisers at Queen's University Belfast, we agreed to postpone CW in Belfast to a future date, with no charges for the change to the room booking dates and catering. 
No catering was needed for the reorganised online event, which led to our decision to reduce the cost of attending.
