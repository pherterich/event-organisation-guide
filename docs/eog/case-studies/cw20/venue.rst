.. _CW20-Venue: 

CW20 Venue
=====================

After a discussion on 9 March 2020 with the local organisers at Queen's University Belfast, we agreed to postpone CW in Belfast to a future date, with no charges for the change to the room booking dates and catering. 
Ultimately, further Government restrictions and lockdown measures throughout March would have prevented the event taking place in person if we had decided to go ahead with an in-person event.

We decided to use `Zoom <https://zoom.us/>`_ for the online venue, which you can read more about in the :ref:`CW20-Infrastructure` section.
