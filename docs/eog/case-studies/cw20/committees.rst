CW20 Committees
=====================


Steering Committee
--------------------------

The CW20 Steering Committee comprised of representatives from Belfast, the workshop sponsors and the Institute. 
Members helped to guide the agenda and direction of the workshop, provided advice for running the event and contributed to many of the workshop sessions.
Before publicly announcing that CW20 would move online, we notified the Steering Committee of our contingency investigation and decision to replace the in-person event with a virtual one. 


Organising Committee
--------------------------

The CW20 Organising Committee comprised of representatives from Belfast and the Institute. 
Members had more regular communication, with a focus on logistics and identifying and being responsible for roles/duties needed to run the event.
Once the decision was made to cancel the in-person event in Belfast and move CW20 online, the committee members from the Institute worked to 

- Create and test the :ref:`infrastructure<CW20-Infrastructure>` for running a virtual event 
- Reformat the :ref:`agenda<CW20-Agenda>` for the online setting
- Adapt the :ref:`publicity<CW20-Publicity>`
- Help :ref:`run the event<CW20-Event-Roles>` on the day


Code of Conduct Committee
--------------------------

The CW20 Code of Conduct (CoC) Committee comprised of three members who were Institute staff and one external. 
There was a mix of gender, race and career stage within the Committee to provide a range of options for participants to choose who they felt most comfortable reporting to.

Before the event, we held a meeting for CoC Committee members to read through and discuss

- The `Code of Conduct <https://www.software.ac.uk/cw20/code-conduct>`_
- The `Procedure for Reporting Harassment <https://www.software.ac.uk/cw20/code-of-conduct/harassment-reporting-procedure>`_
- The Procedure For Handling Reported Harassment

During the event, we had a private Slack channel in the CW20 Slack workspace for CoC Committee members in case any incidents arose.
No misconduct was reported from CW20.
