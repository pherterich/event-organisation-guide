CW20 Closing Down the Event Project Stage
==========================================


At the end of the event
-------------------------

We made participants aware that we would be gathering feedback, following up with them about speed blogs and their prizes at the end of the event.
We thanked the sponsors, volunteers, speakers and workshop facilitators for their contributions towards delivering the event, and we also thanked the participants for engaging under such unprecedented circumstances.


After the event
-------------------------

We emailed participants with a form to collect feedback within a week of the event.
We also had a meeting with the delivery team to compile notes on lessons learned from running the event, what worked well and what could be improved in the future.

In the months after the event, we followed up on the speed blogs that were produced as part of the discussion session. We published them along with reflection blog posts, collected and shared the presentation slides, sanitised and shared the event infrastructure resources, processed and published the session recordings, and contributed to various guides for running virtual events.
You can see the details of the CW20 outputs in the :ref:`CW20-Outputs-and-Outcomes-Plan` and the timeline of when we made them available in the :ref:`CW20-Timeline`.


When are you done?
-------------------------

All of the outputs that we planned to produce are now available and the event is complete.
