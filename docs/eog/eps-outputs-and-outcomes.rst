.. _Outputs-And-Outcomes:

Outputs and Outcomes Plan
=========================
Outputs
*******
It's important to plan what you will make available after the event.  For instance, for a Collaborations Workshop type of event these normally include:

- Presentations
    - From keynotes (slides, videos)
    - From lightning talks  (slides, videos)
    - From mini-workshops (slides)

- Speed blog posts
    - From discussion sessions

- Collaborative ideas
    - Making the final ideas available

- Hack day
    - Information about entries and winners
    - Team/Project name
    - Presentations
    - Links to the software/output

Outcomes
********
Outcomes tend to match objectives but the Event Lead should decide if a report or thematic analysis of the workshop outputs might help highlight any change of outlook due to the workshop.
Feedback results can also be part of this. Longer term analysis (e.g. surveys after the event may also be useful to see if the workshop has, for instance, changed practice or led to further collaborations). See the `Ten simple rules for measuring the impact of workshops <https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006191>`_ for more ideas and guidance.
