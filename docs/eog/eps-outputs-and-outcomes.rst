.. _Outputs-And-Outcomes:

Outputs and Outcomes Plan
=========================
Outputs
*******
Identify what you will make available after the event.  For instance, for a CW type of event this could include:

- Presentations
    - From keynotes (slides, videos)
    - From lightning talks  (slides, videos)
    - From mini-workshops (slides)

- Speed blog posts
    - From discussion sessions

- Collaborative ideas
    - Making the final ideas available

- Hackday
    - Information about entries and winners
    - Team/Project name
    - Presentations
    - Links to the software/output

Outcomes
********
They tend to match to meet objectives but the Event Lead should decide if a report or analysis of the workshop outputs for themes might allow, for example, change of mindset to be detected.
Feedback results can also be part of this. Longer term analysis (e.g. surveys after the event may also be useful to see if the workshop has, for instance, changed practice or led to further collaborations). See the `Ten simple rules for measuring the impact of workshops <https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006191>`_ for more ideas and guidance.
