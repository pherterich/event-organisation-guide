Accommodation
=============
When selecting a venue ask about nearby accommodation options. Consider proximity to the venue and transport links, price range, disabled access and if the venue recommends using a particular provider. Once a final venue has been decided then accommodation needs to be managed more proactively. 

Various approaches towards accommodation could be taken:

- Direct people to find their own
    - This decreases the burden on the organisers but may not create the welcoming and caring impression desired for the event.

- List nearby or recommended accommodation providers on the event page
    - It's important to be clear about whether these are a curated list based on recommendations or just local options. Inform participants if any special discounts have been arranged. 

- Arrange accommodation for all or some of the participants
    - This might be the best way to support staff or invited participants.
    - This may be done to arrange a larger discount in a nearby venue which can then be charged appropriately to participants during registration. There are benefits of attendees at the event in staying at the same hotel, for example, it can make organising social activities and coordinating transport easier. 
  
If accommodation is being arranged for some or all of the participants then investigating the different hotel policies around cancellation and final numbers should be done as soon as possible. All things being equal, hotels which have policies which enable cancellation or transfer of the booking closer to the event date are preferable as this decreases the period of time when a cancellation would lead to financial loss.
