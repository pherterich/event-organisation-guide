Risk Mitigation
===============
Risk mangment is cyclical event that occurs regularly during the Event Project Stage of the project. For the risks that have been assessed as above the risk threshold in the risk assessment mitigation plans  need to be put in place.

Common mitigations strategies fall into the following categoies:

- Avoidance 
   - the risk is avoided entirely by taking a different course of action
- Acceptance 
   - the risk is accepted and contingency plans are made in case it happens
- Transference 
   - we hand the risk over to someone else e.g via insurance
- Limitation 
   - plans are in place to limit the likelihood or impacts of the risk identified

The `example risk template <https://zenodo.org/record/4088024>`_ contains risk mitigation plans for the risks that are assessed as being over the risk threshold in the example event.
