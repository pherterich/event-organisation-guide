Risk Assessment
===============
Typically, risks are assessed against 2 axes - the severity of the impact they have on your event and
probability of them happening, by placing them on the chart such as the one below. Next, they are classified into
several categories on a low - high scale, for example:

- low risk - the risk is acceptable; it is OK to proceed with the event planning but keep an eye on the risk;
- medium risk - the risk needs to be addressed and mitigation strategy put in place;
- high risk - the risk is critical and may have an adverse effect on your event and stakeholders; you may even have to rethink if the event should go ahead.

You can decide for yourself where to draw the boundaries between the risk categories on your risk chart. It is also OK to classify your risks on a more
fine-grained scale, e.g. low, medium, high, extreme - based on your
individual risk assessment. For example, consider the following risk assessment matrix (obtained from `Wikipedia

For events such as the Collaborations Workshop (`CW <https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/collaborations-workshops>`_ ) or Carpentry Connect (`CC <https://software.ac.uk/ccmcr19`_), we typically look at the following risk aspects:

- The main stakeholder and funder (the Software Sustainability Institute)
- Other stakeholders (sponsors, keynote speakers, attendees, session chairs, organising committee members, volunteers/helpers at the event)
- Budget
- Event agenda
- Venue
- Catering
- Communication (with various stakeholders)
- Policies, guidelines and documentation

When identifying risks, bear in mind that they can happen at different times in the planning and implementation stages before the event, as well as during and even after the event.

Here are some examples of risks identified when organising an event such as the CW or CC.

- The main stakeholder
    - Event goals not aligned with the main stakeholder goals
    - Incidents during the event can damage the main stakeholder's reputation

- Sponsors
    - Not enough sponsorship
    - Offers made to sponsors that cannot be fulfilled
    - Sponsor's logo is not displayed at all at the event (or not displayed appropriately), spelling and branding mistakes occur

- Keynote speakers
    - Delay in confirmation or dropping out
    - Speaker go off track in their talk or use offensive language

- Attendees
    - Not enough attendees or many dropping out right before the event
    - Too many attendees
    - Attendees complain about a certain aspect of the event

    - Unexpected bad weather so cannot e.g. take group photo or do social activities outdoors
    - Post-event feedback highlights missed opportunities
