Risk Assessment
===============
At time of evaluation the risks identified can be marked up for the two components that make up risk - i.e. likelihood and impact. The likelihood is the probability of them happening and the impact is a score based on if they did happen what are the ramifications for your event. 

The figure below illustrates the conceptual relationship between likelihood, impact and risk.

Once the risks are assessed with likelihood and impact score they can be visualised on a risk matrix. The likelihood and impact categoeis need not be low, medium and high but different terms and more terms can be used to reflect more subtly in the assessment.

The following is an example risk matrix from the `Wikimedia Commons <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:IC-Risk-Assessment-Matrix-Template.jpg>`_. (the image is available under the CC-BY-SA 4.0 license).

The project can then decide which part of the matrix is above or below the project risk threshold. The risk threshold can be set according to the experience of the team delivering the event or the degree of change in the type of event compared to others, clearly new and complex and larger scale events might need a lower risk threshold. Those risks assessed as being above the events risk threshold are mitigated for. 


See `the disk management template  <https://zenodo.org/record/4088024>`_ for an example that includes a risk matrix.
