Timeline
========
Itâ€™s important to think about a timeline for the project as soon as it has been confirmed. An outline draft and a deeper
draft at the Idea Explortaion Stage and Feasibility Stage would be useful but not essential. 

In the Event Project Stage, a detailed timeline will be needed and should be revised and updated as the project develops to reflect
changes.

An `example timeline <https://zenodo.org/record/4066931>`_ is
available to give a holistic view of some of the considerations in this area.
