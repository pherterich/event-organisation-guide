Timeline
========
Itâ€™s important to think about a timeline for the project as soon as it's confirmed. An outline draft and a more detailed 
draft at the Idea Exploration Stage and Feasibility Stage would be useful but not essential. 

In the Event Project Stage, a detailed timeline will be needed and should be revised and updated as the project develops to reflect changes.

An `example timeline <https://zenodo.org/record/4066931>`_ is available to give a holistic view of some of the considerations in this area.

It's preferable to open registration for the event as soon as possible in the Event Project Stage, as this gives more notice and makes it easier for people to commit to attending. In unconference events where the agenda is progressively elaborated people may wait to see a more developed agenda before registering. For events which have a more traditional (e.g. call based) programme, it makes sense for the (near) final agenda to be available when registration opens. In the latter case it would be preferable to make the dates of the event, any calls and when registration is likely to be made available as soon as possible (the start of the Event Project Stage would be a good time) to allow people to save the date.
