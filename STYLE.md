# Style
We detail language and markup considerations for working with the EOG.

## Titles
Document titles should be in [title case](https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/capitalization/rules-for-capitalization-in-titles.html). Headings and subheadings should be in [sentence case](https://proofreadmyessay.co.uk/writing-tips/title-case-sentence-case-headings/).

## Bulleted lists
For bullet pointed lists, use dash ('-') to denote the list items. Sub-lists should be indented with tabs. For example:
- list item
  - sub item 1
  - sub item 2
    - sub sub item 2.1
     - sub sub item 2.2
  - sub item 3
  
  ## Bulleted lists punctuation
  If your bulleted lists contain sentence fragments, as a style choice we require capitalisation but no full stop at the end. See [this for reference](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/bullet-points/).
