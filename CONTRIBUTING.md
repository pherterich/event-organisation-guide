Please note we have a [code of conduct](https://github.com/softwaresaved/event-organisation-guide/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## What's the purpose of the EOG
The purpose of the EOG is to document how the [SSI](https://www.software.ac.uk], related individual's (e.g. the [SSI Fellows](https://www.software.ac.uk/about/fellows)) and the wider research software community organise events. The order of precences given is the order entities are mentioned in the previous statement.

## What's the scope of the EOG
The scope of the Event Organisation Guide (EOG) is limitied, to keep the guide useful and not too large. Other guides on organising event may exist and be more suited to people's needs.

### In scope 
The EOG is looking to capture actual experience from running events and so the contributions are limited to:

1. ACTUAL - Contributions about event organisation where you **actually** did the things you are contributing as updates or a case study to the guide.
2. PLANNED - Things you will definately do next time you run an event that show a strong understanding of how to integrate a new approach.
3. LINKS - We are happy to link to other resources if we think it's appropriate, please tell us where it should be linked from in the EOG.
4. AOB - We are a friendly bunch - if you have an idea which you think falls into the 'experiential' rather than 'theoretical' category for the EOG - raise and issue and it will be considered.

ACTUAL contribution type information is preferred over PLANNED.

### Out of scope
What is out of scope for the EOG:

+ I found this good guide and can you integrate it into EOG
+ Theorectical event planning is out of scope - we are after experiential knowledge in the EOG
+ I found this link - you should refer to it from the EOG (see 3. above - tell us in which section and why)
